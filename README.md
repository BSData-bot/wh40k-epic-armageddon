## Overview ##

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]


## Notes ##

__Groups__

The datafiles are cross-compatible with army lists currently published and maintained by NetEA, F-ERC, or EpicUK, where applicable. When you create a new roster, you should begin by selecting the community to which you belong, before adding your units. The Horus Heresy files use army lists from EpicAU.

__Translations__

You may notice the different languages have rules variations. Each active community has made developments to suit the needs of their group; the French translations come from F-ERC and reflect their particular developments. The Spanish and Italian language support is only experimental at this stage.

__Army Lists__

Our Repo includes over 135 factions, forces, chapters & regiments, as described by 270 of the _300plus_ army lists currently available, as well as incorporating supplementary features like Riot! or Minigeddon. If there's a particular list you wish to see included, get in touch and we'll consider it. (NB: we'd prefer to stick to lists from the groups noted above to avoid any confusion.)

__Release Numbers__

Release Numbers are shown in four parts. The first part is the _.gst_ version. The second part is a simple counter, starting from 00 and incrementing by 1 with each release since the _.gst_ was last updated. The thrid part is the number of standard _.cat_ files, while the fourth part is the number of forces covered by those _.cat_ files. The third & fourth are not displayed if they are unchanged since the previous release, and they never include Riot, Insurgency, nor the forces contained within those two files.
