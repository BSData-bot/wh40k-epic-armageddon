##Overview##

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]


##Notes##

__Groups__

The datafiles are cross-compatible with army lists currently published and maintained by NetEA, F-ERC, or EpicUK, where applicable. When you create a new roster, you should begin by selecting the community to which you belong, before adding your units.

__Translations__

You may notice the french language rules have variations. Each active community has made developments to suit the needs of their group; the french translations come from F-ERC and reflect their particular developments.

__Army Lists__

The first 50 datafiles provided here covered more than 120 of the _180+_ army lists currently available, as well as incorporating supplementary features, like Riot! or Minigeddon. If there's a particular list you wish to see included, get in touch and we'll consider it. (NB: we'd prefer to stick to lists from the groups noted above to avoid any confusion.)
